            <p> In terms of GWA, we can see that the GWAs of the student leaders are above average because of 
                the positively skewed histogram. They have an average grade of 1.3692 and their grades really don’t
                 vary much as the variation is only 0.17 plus or minus from the mean. Since the most common exact GWA 
                 is 1.5 and 1.5 is right in the lower bracket in relation to the mean, it means that the majority of 
                 student leaders have GWAs that more or less qualifies them into the director’s list. 

                In terms of age, we can see that the most common age of the student leaders surveyed is 16. 
                Age can actually affect the data as the older you are, the higher grade level you are in. 
                And with a higher grade level, comes a heavier academic burden and maybe even harder responsibilities 
                and tasks as a student leader.
