                <p>Our sample comprises 50 student leaders. They can either be student leaders 
                last year or both last year and current year student leaders. The target population is all 
                student leaders from all schools. We wished to have every student leader position and every 
                school from elementary to college included in our study but obviously, that is not possible.</p>

              <p>We sampled our data by using online surveys created using Google Forms. 
                We then made a list of student leaders that we wanted to send it to. We sent 
                the surveys directly to them through facebook private messages. </p>
